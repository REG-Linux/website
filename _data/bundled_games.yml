  platform: "Atari2600"
  description: |
    The aim of the game is to guide the amoeba (a single-celled creature) up a never-ending
    series of platforms without falling. The higher you get, the higher your score will be.
    There are three different platform types: Yellow - these are the basic, stable platforms
    White - these are unstable platforms that disappear after you bounce off them once Blue -
    these platforms are harder to hit because they move back and forth horizontally Jumping on
    a red or green spring-button will give you a short boost and some bonus points, but best
    of all: it makes the little amoeba rejoice! When your score gets beyond 1000 points,
    little oval-shaped bacteria start appearing on the platforms, which can be eaten by the
    amoeba. Each bacteria holds one of the six letters from the word A-M-O-E-B-A. Collect all
    six and the single next time you jump on a spring, you will get a super long boost.

    Similar to the original, Relentless 64 is a high speed, non-stop score-chasing shmup with
    some neat score chaining mechanics. The enemy waves come at you thick and fast, and taking
    out an entire wave rewards you with an increasing score multipler, resetting back to 1x
    should you miss a ship or crash.

    A game is inspired by a host of older titles with the same theme, going all the way back
    to Gun Fight from 1975. You play a cowboy out to win a fierce gun duel. The first one to
    outwit and knock down the opponent 5 times is the winner of the duel.  Instructions: Each
    gun can carry 5 bullets. You reload by manually replacing the bullets with a click of the
    joystick button, or you can pick up bullet packs from the ground. But beware! If your
    opponent catches you out of the safety of the cacti, then you might get knocked down!
    Explosive crates appear around the play area. They explode when shot, so better stay away
    from them if you value you life, cowboy!
