    Each REG Linux release ships tuned kernels, overlays, firmware, DTBs, and rescue workflows per board tree.
    The wiki’s board directory documents how we handle Broadcom, Allwinner, Amlogic, Rockchip, Qualcomm, Mediatek, and Samsung devices.

  title: Drill into the wiki board trees
  body: >
    The board README files walk through kernel config, overlays, firmware, DTB layout, and `genimage.cfg` partitions per device.
    Follow the wiki links above to see which DTBs, firmware blobs, or u-boot binaries belong to an SoC before flashing.
