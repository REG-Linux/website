  wiki_url: "https://reglinux.org/wiki/sbcs/broadcom/"
  summary: "Each Broadcom board directory (BCM2711/BCM2712/BCM2837/BCM2836/BCM2835) stages kernels, DTBs, firmware, overlays, and patches before genimage builds the FAT/Share layout for Pi and Compute Module hardware."

    - "BCM2711"
    - "BCM2712"
    - "BCM2837"
    - "BCM2836"
    - "BCM2835"
  highlights:
    - "Board scripts copy Image, initrd, DTBs, and firmware while rewiring `boot/config.txt` + `cmdline.txt` to enable DRM/KMS helpers, fastboot, `noswap`, and other runtime defaults."
    - "`genimage.cfg` produces a 2 GiB REGLINUX FAT32 boot volume plus a 256 MiB userdata/SHARE slice for BCM2711/BCM2712 builds, while the older SoCs keep their legacy layouts."
    - "Overlays/patches load modules such as `snd_seq`, `i2c_dev`, and other audio helpers so GroovyMAME, RetroArch, and libretro cores stay compatible with the VC4/VC6 GPUs."

    - "Genio 1200"
  highlights:
    - "The overlay copies MT7961/MT7668/MT8183/MT8188/MT8195 firmware under `/lib/firmware` so Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and audio work correctly."
    - "Kernel configs and patches capture the Linux 6.15.0-rc2 options plus HDMI/ALSA wiring required by the MT8395 Genio 1200 board."
    - "`genimage.cfg` stages the kernel, initrd, modules, firmware, rescue blobs, and bootloader artifacts into a GPT image with a 2 GiB REGLINUX boot partition plus a 256 MiB SHARE userdata slice."

  highlights:
    - "REG Linux keeps per-SoC trees (RK3128, RK3288, RK3326, RK3328, RK3399, RK3568, RK3588) with targeted kernel versions, overlays, and DTBs that stage scripts and update blobs before `genimage` packages the image."
    - "Highlights cover Linux 6.10 for RK3128, 6.6 for RK3288, 6.12 for RK3326, and 6.1+ for RK3588, along with overlay helpers for temperature, ALSA cards, and Moonlight/GPU patches."

  highlights:
    - "Kernel configs (linux-exynos5422-defconfig) and patches tune LZ4 compression, REG Linux branding, preemption, and DRM/HID quirks for the ODROID platform."
    - "Board scripts stage zImage, DTBs, initrd, modules, firmware, rescue data, and U-Boot blobs before `genimage` creates FAT32 boot + userdata partitions with the proper `extlinux.conf` command line."
    - "Overlays install `asound.conf`, fan scripts, and patch sets for Sugarbox/SwitchRes; the integration tips remind maintainers to build U-Boot, stage artifacts, and document overlay/cmdline changes."
