# Controller Setup

REG Linux supports common USB and Bluetooth controllers. Use this guide to get a working Player 1 profile quickly.

## First-time mapping

- Plug in a controller (USB or 2.4 GHz dongle).
- When prompted, hold a face button to start the mapping flow.
- Follow the on-screen prompts and confirm the layout.

If the prompt does not appear, open the controller configuration from the main menu and start a new mapping there.

## Bluetooth pairing

- Put the controller in pairing mode.
- Open the Bluetooth settings and scan for new devices.
- Select the controller and complete pairing.
- Reboot once if the controller does not reconnect automatically.

## Common fixes

- If directions feel swapped or inverted, remap the controller and verify the D-pad and left stick entries.
- If hotkeys do not work, re-run the controller mapping to set a hotkey button.
- If multiple controllers are connected, unplug extras and map only one device at a time.

## Verify the setup

- Launch a lightweight system (for example, a 16-bit console) to confirm buttons and hotkeys.
- If a single game needs a custom layout, use the per-game or per-core remapping tools.
