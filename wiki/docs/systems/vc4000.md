## Overview

The Interton VC 4000 (1978) is a second-generation European console built around GI chipsets and sold under multiple brands. REG-Linux treats it as `vc4000` so the themed art appears correctly and the MAME core can load the unique cartridges.

## Technical specifications

- CPU: General Instrument CP1610 (customized 16-bit) running near 2 MHz.
- Memory: 1 KB RAM plus cartridge ROM/EPROM banks mapped into the slot.
- Display: 256×192 resolution with fixed tile/sprite hardware derived from GI chips.
- Sound: Single-channel tone generator with noise, output through the built-in speaker.

### Quick reference

- **ROM folder:** `/userdata/roms/vc4000`
- **Accepted formats:** `.bin`, `.rom`, `.pgm`, `.tvc`, `.zip`, `.7z`
- **Emulators:** MAME / `libretro: mame`
- **System group:** `vc4000`, `arcade`

## Technical specifications

- CPU: General Instrument CP1610 derivative running near 2 MHz.
- Memory: 1 KB RAM plus cartridge ROM banks mapped into the slot.
- Display: 256×192 tile/sprite hardware from GI’s video chips.
- Sound: Single-channel tone generator with noise output built into the chassis.

## ROMs

Drop each VC 4000 dump into `/userdata/roms/vc4000`. Zipped archives are acceptable if they place the ROM in the root of the archive (no nested folders). Support for `.pgm`/`.tvc` files covers the cartridge versions marketed around Europe.

## Emulators

This system uses MAME (via RetroArch or standalone) to emulate the hardware. Access `[HOTKEY]` + south face button to open the Quick Menu and adjust shared `vc4000.*` settings (videomode, shaders, ratio) or edit `mame.ini` for more advanced `mame.video`, `mame.bgfxbackend`, and artwork toggles.

## Controls & troubleshooting

VC 4000 games rely on simple joystick/button input; use the default arcade overlay or save a remap when needed. If a ROM refuses to boot, verify the extension and keep the archive flattened. For general questions consult the generic support pages.
