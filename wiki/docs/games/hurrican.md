## Overview

Hurrican is a freeware action-platformer inspired by the Turrican series. REG-Linux runs it via a native port entry so the experience appears with other PC engines.

### Quick reference

- **ROM folder:** `/userdata/roms/hurrican`
- **Accepted format:** `.game`
- **Engine:** Native Hurrican port
- **System group:** `ports`

## BIOS

No BIOS is required.

## Game data

Install the files through the Content Downloader or manually drop the `.game` folder into `/userdata/roms/hurrican/`. The entry appears once the downloader creates the launcher file.

## Controls

Hurrican uses standard controller mapping for ports. Use the Quick Menu or `/remapping_controls_per_emulator` to remap buttons if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure `/userdata/roms/hurrican/` contains a `.game` folder created by the downloader.
- Remove and reinstall the package if the entry does not appear or the port crashes.
- Consult the generic support pages for additional guidance.
