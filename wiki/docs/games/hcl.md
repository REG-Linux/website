## Overview

Hydra Castle Labyrinth is a Metroidvania-inspired action platformer delivered as a native port on REG-Linux. It joins the other indie ports in the `ports` category with its own launcher.

### Quick reference

- **ROM folder:** `/userdata/roms/hcl`
- **Accepted format:** `.game`
- **Engine:** Native HCL binary
- **System group:** `ports`

## BIOS

No BIOS is needed.

## Game data

Install the HCL data via the Content Downloader into `/userdata/roms/hcl/`. Once the package is present, the `.game` entry surfaces in EmulationStation automatically.

## Controls

The default mapping uses the RETROpad for movement, attacks, and jumps. Adjust button mapping in the Quick Menu or through `/remapping_controls_per_emulator` if you need alternative bindings.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify the Content Downloader created a `.game` folder inside `/userdata/roms/hcl/`.
- Delete the folder and reinstall via the downloader if the game fails to appear or crashes.
- For additional help consult the generic support pages.
