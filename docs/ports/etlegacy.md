https://www.splashdamage.com/games/wolfenstein-enemy-territory/

Copy the .pk3 files from the folder `etmain` from your installation into this rom folder ensuring they're added to their own `etmain` folder.
i.e. /userdata/roms/etlegacy/etmain

Create a blank file `Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory.etl` which will launch the game & allow you to scrape the game data via EmulationStation.

       Game controllers can also be configured for your user.
