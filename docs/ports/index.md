# Ports

This folder collects all systems whose EmulationStation entry is marked as `hardware: port`. Each page mirrors the structure of the emulated-system files (overview, technical specification, ROM extensions, emulator hints, and upstream notes) but focuses on ports/engine ports such as `DXX-Rebirth`, `OpenBOR`, or community remakes.

Use these pages when you are cataloguing a ported project that REG Linux ships with—many of them require additional content (WADs, modern engines, fan-made assets) rather than traditional ROM dumps.
