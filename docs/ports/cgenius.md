## Notes

Commander Genius is a software piece that interprets the Commander Keen and Cosmos the Cosmic Adventure series.

Requirements:

You need the original DOS game files in a directory under /userdata/roms/cgenius in order to play on Commander Genius games.
`Commander Keen: Marooned on Mars` and `Secret of the Oracle` are shareware. They can also be downloaded from Commander Genius.
`Commander Keen: The Earth Explodes` and `Commander Keen: Keen Must Die!` are registered versions which can be purchased from 3D Realms or Apogee.
Keen 5 and 6 also need to be purchased.

Games need to be extracted into the /userdata/roms/cgenius/games directory in their own directory per game.
i.e. /userdata/roms/cgenius/games/Keen1/

You then need to create a .cgenius filename extension in that folder.
i.e. /userdata/roms/cgenius/games/Keen1/Commander Keen 1 - Marooned on Mars.cgenius
This will be the file that helps launch the game directly but also should be named to make it easier to scrape.

Note: Some 'mods' can also be downloaded via Commander Genius also.
