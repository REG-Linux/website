# Developers

This section is for contributors building REG Linux, working on tooling, or extending system behavior.

## Start here

- Learn the system layout and boot flow: [Architecture](../architecture.md).
- Build from source: [Developer guide](../dev-guide.md).
- Reference supported hardware for testing: [Devices](../devices/index.md).

If you are focused on device bring-up or catalog accuracy, also review [Maintainers](../maintainers/index.md).
