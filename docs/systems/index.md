# Emulated Systems

This folder exposes the EmulationStation `es_systems.yml` data that REG Linux ships with. Each file corresponds to a supported system (for example `snes.md`) and covers:

* Metadata (manufacturer, release year, hardware type)
* Supported ROM extensions and compatible emulator packages
* Notes pulled from the upstream `es_systems.yml` comments (English/French/Portuguese)

Use these pages when preparing ROM folders, satisfying BIOS/extension requirements, or documenting the systems REG Linux supports.
