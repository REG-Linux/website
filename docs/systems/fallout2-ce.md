## Notes

Fallout 2 Community Edition is a fully working re-implementation of Fallout 2.
It provides the same original gameplay, engine bugfixes, and some quality of life improvements.

You must own the game to play. Purchase your copy on GOG or Steam.
Copy the contents of your Fallout 2 folder from your Windows installation to your roms folder:
/userdata/roms/fallout2-ce

Create a blank file called `Fallout 2.f2ce` this allows for scrapping & helps launch the game via EmulationStation.

Note: This game currently requires a mouse and keyboard to play.
