## Notes

Place your commercial version of Rise of the Triad installation files in here.

You should include DARKWAR.WAD, DARKWAR.RTL, DARKWAR.RTC & REMOTE1.RTS as a minimum.
File names can be upper or lower case.

Then create the file `Rise of the Triad.rott`. This will enable EmulationStation to launch the game.

You do not need to enable the joystick or gamepad as compatiblity doesn't work well yet.
We have mapped the controller to keyboard events as a result.
