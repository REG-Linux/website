- Display: Graphics Synthesizer GPU (147 MHz) with 16.7 million color output, capable of 2D/3D GPU features at 640×480.

## Supported ROM extensions

zip

## Emulators

- **play** (play)

## Notes

The Play! emulator provides `work in progress` support for Namco 246 & 256 systems.
Currently you will need a high performance system to be able to emulate supported games.
We recommend using the OpenGL API for now.

This rom directory should include a zip file based on the arcade id and a supporting folder with associated .chd file.
i.e. Tekken 4 - tekken4.zip
