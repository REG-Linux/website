## Notes

Theme Hospital engine written in LUA.
Grab a copy of your game or get it on GoG.
Copy the extracted folder with their contents from your Theme Hospital install (or use innoextract) into `/userdata/roms/corsixth/`
Create a corsixth.game file into '/userdata/roms/corsixth/'
If you want to listen to non-Theme-Hospital music or use an remastered version of original soundtracks, create a folder MP3 inside '/userdata/roms/corsixth/' and add your MP3 files.
If you want to change the names of songs ingame, into MP3 folder make a file called names.txt and write the file name on one row, followed by the desired ingame name on the next row.
