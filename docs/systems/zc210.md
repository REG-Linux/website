# Zelda Classic

## Overview

Zelda Classic is a fan-made action-RPG engine that recreates classic Zelda titles and custom quests. REG-Linux maps it through the `zc210` system entry so the `libretro: zc210` core and its `qst` files appear in the games list alongside other PC-based platforms.

## Technical specifications

- Manufacturer: Ports
- Release year: 1999
- Hardware type: console
- Platform tag: pc

### Quick reference

- **ROM folder:** `/userdata/roms/zc210`
- **Accepted formats:** `.qst`
- **Emulators:** `libretro: zc210`
- **System group:** `zc210`

## BIOS

The core requires `zcdata.dat` plus optional SoundFont presets for music playback. Place the following files under `/userdata/bios/zc210/` so the emulator can initialize sound and quest resources:

| Filename                     | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `zcdata.dat`                 | Base Zelda Classic data archive |
| `sf2/default.sf2`            | Default General MIDI sound bank |
| `sf2/custom0.sf2` … `custom9.sf2` | Alternate sound banks supplied by the project |
| `zcsf.sf2`                   | Legacy fallback MIDI bank |

## ROMs

Drop `.qst` quest files inside `/userdata/roms/zc210`. These packages usually come from the Zelda Classic editor and can be kept zipped or uncompressed as long as the core can reach the root map file.

## Emulators

### libretro: zc210

RetroArch exposes standard options (`zc210.videomode`, `zc210.shaders`, etc.) plus input remapping if you need to swap controls with a gamepad. The core reads the bios blobs above and scans the ROM folder for the `.qst` archives.

## Controls

The default pad layout binds South/East/West to the action buttons and maps the D-pad to Zelda-style movement. Remap buttons from the Quick Menu as needed for text input, especially when the game prompts for keyboard commands.

## Troubleshooting

- Keep all BIOS files in `/userdata/bios/zc210/`; missing sound banks will fall back to generic MIDI and reduce music quality.
- Rename `.qst` files so they remain unique inside `/userdata/roms/zc210`, and ensure the archive contains the `.zcs` map the core expects.
